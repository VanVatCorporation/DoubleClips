DoubleClips is an open-source, ready-to-use video editor with functionality similar to CapCut. It offers Community Templates, Cross-platform rendering, Multitrack editing, and a variety of effects!

## Current Features

- Export project
- Render cross-platform (By saving it as a zip file including the JSON timeline, transfer it to your PC, or other stronger devices, and use it to render the clip, you can easily render across platforms)
- Full control over export parameters (including Constant Rate Factor, Width, Height, Framerate and etc. Allows you to input any value you prefer. Higher settings may take longer to render. The limitations depend on the devices used. Yup, we can render 4k, 8k, 16k or whatever k you want)
- Multitrack editing
- No watermarks or subscriptions
- ~~Profiles and status~~
- ~~Transactions~~ (Not what you might think! We can upload the template, set the price for people to buy, and you earn 80% of the transactions. Purchased templates can be customized however the buyers want. It‚Äôs literally their right to own it.)
- ~~Real-time preview~~ (still in development)
- ~~Sharable templates~~ (still in development, but yes, the template feature allows you to create videos super quickly, similar to CapCut. However, what CapCut lacks is the ability to modify the template edit fully, giving you complete control over the chosen template. For template creators, you also have full control over the templates you share, meaning you can disable the modification feature to prevent others from customizing it, kind of like GitHub's fork, branch, and similar features).

## Requirements

### Windows / MacOS / Linux

- We are currently working on the Android version, so it isn't available yet.
   
### iOS

- We are currently working on the Android version, so it isn't available yet.

### Android

- Minimum SDK: 24 (Nougat, Android 7.0)
- FFmpeg Support (You can check if your device supports it by opening the app).

And that's actually it! High-end devices render quickly, low-end devices render slowly, but the functionality remains the same!


## Donate

Most open-source projects are nearly non-profitable, which means we rely on your support to survive this harsh reality. Instead of asking for subscriptions ‚Äî no, we don‚Äôt do that here ‚Äî why not consider donating so the project can develop faster?
